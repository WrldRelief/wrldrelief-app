For Windsurf IDE development, follow the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture for code organization and primarily use the Worldcoin/mini-apps-ui-kit-react for UI components to ensure consistency and efficiency. When building new features, first determine the correct FSD layer and then prioritize using existing UI kit components, only creating custom ones as a last resort with justification. This approach guarantees a scalable, maintainable, and visually unified IDE.
